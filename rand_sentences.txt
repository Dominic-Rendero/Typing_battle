The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.
"To be or not to be, that is the question."
All that glitters is not gold.
The pen is mightier than the sword.
Actions speak louder than words.
A picture is worth a thousand words.
"When in Rome, do as the Romans do."
Fortune favors the bold.
The early bird catches the worm.
